This code is for the 2017 [MIT PPAT](http://ppat.mit.edu/fall2017/index.html) Team Dave project. It is for controlling a TV from an iPad. This code is used to run a server on an [ESP8266 NodeMCU](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B010O1G1ES/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1511196896&sr=8-4&keywords=esp8266+nodemcu) which controls the IR LED. The server has REST endpoints for power, volume up/down, jumping to a certain volume, and entering a specific channel.
